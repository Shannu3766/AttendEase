3. **Setup Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add a new Android/iOS app and download the `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist`.

## Firebase Setup

Ensure the following Firestore collections and documents are configured:

1. **User Collection**: 
   ```
   <user-id>/Semester/<semester-number>/Subjects
   ```
   - **Fields**:
     - `subjects`: List of objects containing:
       - `subcode`: Subject code.
       - `subname`: Subject name.

2. **Attendance Collection**:
   ```
   <user-id>/Attendence/<semester-number>
   ```
   - **Fields**:
     - `subjects`: List of objects containing:
       - `subcode`: Subject code.
       - `attended`: Boolean (true if the class was attended).

## How It Works
